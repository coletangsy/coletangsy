- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Data Science, Machine Learning, and of course, Esports!
- ðŸŒ± Recently completed the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate**. For now, I am taking a **16-week full-time Data Science and Machine Learning Immersive Bootcamp**. Also, I'm going through some micro-courses provided by **Kaggle, Google**, and **online course on Udemy** too!
- ðŸŒ» I will upload some previous exercises, web-scraping projects, and datasets I used for my data-analysis practices here. For my data analysis projects, please check my Kaggle. (I will upload here, but later =P)
