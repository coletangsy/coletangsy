- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nicole Tang,
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Data Science, Machine Learning, and of course, Esports!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on my **Google Data Analyst Professional Certificate** & **Full-time Data Science and Machine Learning Immersive Bootcamp**. And also, I'm going through some micro-courses provided by **Kaggle, Google**, and **online course on Udemy** too!
- ðŸŒ» I will upload some previous exercises, web-scraping projects, and datasets I used for my data-analysis practices here. For my data analysis projects, please check my Kaggle. (I will upload here, but later =P)
- ðŸ“« My data analysis projects: https://www.kaggle.com/nicoletangsy
